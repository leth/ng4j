    <p>NamedGraphSet implementation backed by a relational database.</p>
    <p>A NamedGraphSet is stored in a single Quad table. A secondary table
      contains the names (URIs) of all graphs in the set. This is necessary
      because we want to be able to store empty graphs. Multiple NamedGraphSets
      can be stored in the same DB by using table name prefixes.</p>
    <p>NamedGraphSetDB implements the public NamedGraphSet interface. NamedGraphDB
      instances are handed out by NamedGraphSetDB methods like <tt>getGraph</tt>.
      They remain backed by the database; changes to them will be reflected in
      the DB. QuadDB is the backend doing the actual SQL work.</p>
