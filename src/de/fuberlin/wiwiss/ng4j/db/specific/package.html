    <p>Support for different database engines.</p>
    <p>The abstract class DbCompatibility defines methods which need to
      be implemented for each database type and provides default implementations
      for some of them, which should be overridden as necessary.  
      Each of these methods are called from the QuadDB class in the 
      parent package, de.fuberlin.wiwiss.ng4j.db.<p>
    <p>To provide support for an additional database type it is necessary
      to 1. create a new subclass of DbCompatibility, and 2. edit the QuadDB
      class to check for the new database product name and set the database
      type accordingly.<p>
