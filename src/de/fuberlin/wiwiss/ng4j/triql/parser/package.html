    <p>A <a href="http://www.wiwiss.fu-berlin.de/suhl/bizer/TriQL/">TriQL</a>
      parser. It is based on Jena's RDQL parser.</p>
    <p>The parser is generated by the JJTree/JavaCC tool.</p>
    <p>Most classes are boilerplate
      code that was automatically generated. The package mixes completely
      auto-generated classes and hand-edited code.</p>
    <p><tt>triql.jjt</tt> contains the JJTree grammar. <tt>triql.jj</tt> is
      generated from that automatically by the JJTree tool. The JavaCC tool
      generates some of the Java files in this package from <tt>triql.jj</tt>.</p>
    <p>The parser creates a parse tree for the query. The Q_Query class is the 
      root node. Its buildQuery method grabs all the interesting stuff from the
      tree and puts it into a TriQLQuery object. Only the constraints (AND clauses)
      are left in parse tree form.</p>
    <p>The TriQLQuery object is then used by the query engine.</p>
