Bug fix in the SemWebClLib: eliminated a concurrency issue in TaskQueueBase

Minor performance improvement - implemented a custom determination of the size of a SWClGraphMem

04/25/09 (Olaf)
Finished the SemWebClLib-specific Graph implementation which improves performance of query executions. For details see:

04/13/09 (Olaf)
Fixed bug in TriG writer - some namespace prefixes were used without being defined

First commit of a SemWebClLib-specific Graph implementation which improves performance of query executions. For details see:

02/23/09 (Olaf)
Bug fix in the SemWebClLib: pending deref tasks for find queries are identified by the corresponding URIs; in case of hash-URIs: mismatch between requested and dereferenced URI caused blocking until timeouts; now: cut off hash part identifying URIs; huge performance gain!

Release 0.9
-----------

We neglected to update from wstx-asl-2.8.jar to wstx-asl-3.0.0.jar when we upgraded to ARQ 2.4 for release 0.8 of ng4j.  Updated the library.
Generalize the sizes of fields used for databases which allow variable-length varchars.  The field size is set in DbCompatibility and used (in classes which support it) when tables are initially created.

02/10/09 (Jennifer)
Fixed NamedGraphModel code so that when it uses a TriGWriter, the writer includes the model's namespace prefix map.
This fix was supplied by Daryl McCullough of Architecture Technology Corporation.

01/21/09 (Olaf)
Removed TriQL

01/19/09 (Jennifer)
Add support for Apache Derby database.
Change Eclipse compiler settings for project to require Java 1.5 instead of 1.4.

01/16/09 (Olaf)
Applied Jennifer's patch: 2496503 "Refactor SWP code and remove deprecated TriQL"

01/15/09 (Olaf)
Bug fix in the SemWebClLib: Multiple deref listeners can be attached to a single deref task. Due to this change, multiple find queries may benefit from the graph retrieved for the task.

Release 0.8
